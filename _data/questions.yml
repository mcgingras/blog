- name: Is it good to be a generalist?
  subtext: I consider myself a generalist. However, sometimes I feel I'd be better off finding something I really enjoy, and focusing specifically on that. "Justin g." puts it best in his <a _target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/itunpredictable/status/1346235218072457217?s=20">tweet</a>, "thinking about the worst advice i've gotten in my (short) career, 'being a generalist' is probably the most destructive thing i was told. It actively set me back my a couple of years. Having been on the hiring side at a few startups now, let me tell you - the number of times we've been looking for a 'generalist' is zero (0)." Is there merit to being a generalist?

- name: At what point are abstractions bad?
  subtext: Tread too high up the ladder of abstraction and you aren't able to understand anything that is outside the scope of the abstraction. Related -- is Webflow actually helping anyone learn to code? Does it even need to be?
- name: Is social media net-positive?
  subtext: Loneliness, political divide etc. But there are many benefits. How do we improve social media? Can we?
