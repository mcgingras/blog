<p>Hi, I'm Michael. <i>(Not Mike)</i></p>

<p> I live in Boston and write code at <a href="https://gearflow.com" target="_blank"> Gearflow</a>. I studied CS
  at Cornell and
  was many times a fellow at <a href="https://ideocolab.com" target="_blank"> IDEO CoLab</a>.
  I like competitive things and I race for <a href="https://www.fullsendtriathlon.com/" target="_blank">Full Send
    Triathlon</a>.</p>


<p>I'm curious about a lot of things. I'm not yet sure if this is a good thing or not. It's one of my
  <a href="questions.html"> questions.</a>
  Either way, I maintain a <a href="interests.html"> backlog</a> of interesting topics.
  Contact me if you'd like to talk about any of them; I absolutely love making friends online.
