<p>Hi, I'm Michael. (Not Mike.)</p>

<p> I live in Boston and work at <a href="https://gearflow.com" target="_blank"> Gearflow</a>. I previously studied CS
    at Cornell and
    was many times a fellow at <a href="https://ideocolab.com" target="_blank"> IDEO CoLab</a>.
    I like competitive things and I run for Full Send Triathlon.</p>

<p>I'm interested in how to conduct research outside the walls of academia. My current interest is making playful
    creative tools for learning experiences. People spend large amounts of time and effort playing games. Can these
    games teach valuable skills? <a target="_blank"

        Runescape</a> teaches it's players economics. Minecraft teaches logic through redstone. Can we intentionally
    create games that educate while being _actually fun_?</p>

<p>I'm interested in a lot of things. I'm not yet sure if this is a good thing or not. It's one of my
    <a href="questions.html"> questions.</a>
    Either way, I maintain a <a href="interests.html"> backlog</a> of things I am interested in.
    Contact me if you'd like to talk about any of them; I absolutely love making friends online.</p>
