<p>Hi, I'm Michael. <i>(Not Mike)</i></p>

<p>
  I live in Fort Collins and write code for
  <a href="https://soraschools.com/" target="_blank"> Sora Schools</a>. I
  studied CS at Cornell and was many times a fellow at
  <a href="https://ideocolab.com" target="_blank"> IDEO CoLab</a>. Outside of
  work I do a whole bunch of running.
</p>

<p>
  I'm curious about a lot of things. I'm not yet sure if this is a good thing or
  not. It's one of my
  <a href="questions.html"> questions.</a>
  Either way, I maintain a <a href="interests.html"> backlog</a> of interesting
  topics. Contact me if you'd like to talk about any of them; I absolutely love
  making friends online.
