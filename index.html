<p>Hi, I'm Michael. (Not Mike.)</p>

<p> I live in Boston and work at <a href="https://gearflow.com" target="_blank"> Gearflow</a>. I studied CS
    at Cornell and
    was many times a fellow at <a href="https://ideocolab.com" target="_blank"> IDEO CoLab</a>.
    I like competitive things and I race for Full Send Triathlon.</p>

<p>How might we conduct research outside the walls of academia? I reject the idea that you need the validation of an
    institution to do valuable research. Currently Im interested in research around making playful
    creative tools for learning experiences. People spend large amounts of time and effort playing games. Can these
    games teach valuable skills? <a target="_blank"

        Runescape</a> teaches it's players economics. <a
        href="https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Mechanics/Redstone/Logic_circuit">Minecraft</a> teaches logic through
    redstone. Can we intentionally
    create games that educate while being _actually fun_?</p>

<p>I'm interested in a lot of things. I'm not yet sure if this is a good thing or not. It's one of my
    <a href="questions.html"> questions.</a>
    Either way, I maintain a <a href="interests.html"> backlog</a> of things I am interested in.
    Contact me if you'd like to talk about any of them; I absolutely love making friends online.</p>
